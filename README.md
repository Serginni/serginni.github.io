# My dream is to become a Full Stack web developer.Technically if you look at my resume, you would think why would a Sociologist graduate from UNLV with a background in Engineering, would want to become a Full Stack Developer?
# After looking into these big online platforms, seeing them getting more and more popular, it sparked a light bulb! An idea came to mind and I thought to myself...I could make something great. 
# After a few years of studying on my own time, I'm going to put myself to the test (next to working a full time job) to become a Full Stack Web or Software Developer.
